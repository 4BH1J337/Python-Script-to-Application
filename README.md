     permission to execute the commands. # ParentContainsErrorRecordException]
  
   * Check Spellings Before Running the commands, Do not put any Space in your main python programme Name. [# File not found show]
   
   * Do not use the " icon " word as a name of yours. ICO [icon] file; always use a different name. [ # It will show no icon file found]
